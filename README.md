Percept Connects interpretation of motion laws and the use of energetic network sequences and information for the process of location arrival  

Content composure while en route to learning or networking experiences creates observatory experiences which allow for unconscious memory to be in use for geographical manuevering while conscious and working memory keeps aware (Bus or Train) or drives and tunes to content

                                              Laws of Motion and Travel
                                              
LAW NUMBER ONE: An object at rest stays at rest. In-ter-rest begins to change as emotions are provoked by external feelings.   An object in motion stays in motion. An object in motion is one with pre-disposed causes or ancestrial dis-positions. Alteration happens at speed or pace and cause rates or number of intersections to vary depending on emotional capacity to be utulized at destination.

LAW NUMBER TWO: Force acts while acceleration results. When net force is applied the object accelerates.

Force = Content Sequence

Content is energy which provides advocacy for trait, ability or chracteristic in need of increase for further population awareness and consciousness

Content network sequence creates in-stances that are to be learned by population as tendencies and behaviors as energy travels through the network to create new population parameters.

Acceleration results = "WHY?" or purpose to stand or being in motion.

LAW NUMBER THREE: The law of action and reaction begins after an intersection or gathering upon EI use or emotional investment which creates consequences that produce reactions and responses when all parties involved arrive at separate spaces to continue neural progression.
